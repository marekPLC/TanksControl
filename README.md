Tank control via WAGO PLC 750-881
I used WAGO PLC series 750 with CPU 881 to simulate tank control with 3 sensors.
Sensors are displayed in array Tank1 and Tank2 -sensor hi, ok, low.
To get the idea open the image called TankScheme.png and get idea of logic gates open Fault control Valves control.png
